                                <p>At Essent, our view on energy is that Sustainability and the energy transition
                                    are about people‘s behavior. We want to help everyone take their next step
                                    in energy and to do so we’ve planned simple, sustainable, and affordable
                                    solutions. In our ambition to deliver these products that will change the
                                    behavior of our customers, I’m convinced that we will need to deliver 100-fold
                                    product iterations before we hit the bullseye.</p>
                                
<h2>What does it take to become a true Tech Company?</h2>

                                <p>It seems obvious that energy and utilities need to transform into something
                                    sustainable and less dependent on foreign sources. Which is easier said
                                    than done. Essent and E.ON are positioned well to have a genuine impact
                                    on the global energy transition: we work with suppliers, customers, and
                                    all other parties involved. We do experiments, learn what works and also
                                    learn what doesn’t work. One of the crucial enablers for Essent to have
                                    this impact is a fast and reliable IT Delivery. This has to do with short
                                    feedback cycles, fast releases, small increments, high performance, and
                                    a great user experience. Taking on this role will help us to become a true
                                    Tech Company.</p>
                                
<h2>Being a true tech company is not just about technology</h2>

                                <p>Many aspects are equally relevant. In all these aspects, we can improve
                                    and continue to learn:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Our leadership is inspiring and triggers real conversations driving sustainable
                                        continuous growth.</li>
                                    <li>Our engineers have automated repetitive and error-sensitive work so they
                                        can be creative and innovate together with our business.</li>
                                    <li>Our teams work on goals that relate to our customers. With end-to-end
                                        responsibility, they commit to results instead of deliverables.</li>
                                    <li>Our architecture is elegant. We understand it and co-create it along the
                                        way.</li>
                                    <li>Our technology is enabling us to accelerate and facilitates the craftsmanship
                                        of our engineers.</li>
                                    <li>Our systems are simply great. We know what they do and we have zero planned
                                        downtime.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>But most of all, as a tech company we put our customers first and our
                                    engineers in the driver's seat.</p>
                                
<h2>Our journey ahead</h2>

                                <p>Last year we merged the old ops and dev teams into a DevOps teams. This
                                    means that our scrum teams are responsible for both new development and
                                    operational excellence in production. It took us about a year from the
                                    first pilot up until the last piece of ops responsibility we pulled into
                                    the ARTs. Now we’re planning for our next steps. We see three themes to
                                    work on:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A standardized Agile and DevOps way of working.</li>
                                    <li>Simplified microservice architecture</li>
                                    <li>And top tech talent.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>At the time of writing this blog, we’re currently in sprint 187. For 186
                                    times we have started and ended a sprint. Every three weeks, we learn,
                                    we deliver, and we improve. Still, we have a lot to learn and improve on.
                                    New teams have joined and new applications have been built. We currently
                                    have 25 IT teams, organized in three Agile Release Trains, but often times
                                    it feels like this is not enough to keep up with our ambitions. That’s
                                    what I love about Essent. We’re never satisfied. Good enough is simply
                                    not excellent.</p>
                                <p>Each of the three themes we’re working on come with their own challenges,
                                    but the fun part is that every result on any of the three themes immediately
                                    affects the others. It’s like a set of gear wheels. No matter which one
                                    you turn, everything moves. Our landscape is complex and our market changes
                                    rapidly. Looking at these challenges ahead of us, one thing is very clear.
                                    It’s not about working hard. It’s about working smart.</p>
