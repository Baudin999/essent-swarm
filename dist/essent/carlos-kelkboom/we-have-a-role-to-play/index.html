                                <h1>How a pencil is made</h1>

                                <p>“There is not a single human being who could make a modern pencil from
                                    scratch!” This is a bold statement and a true one. A pencil consists of
                                    so many parts that there is not a single person in the world who could
                                    do it by themselves. There trees which needs to be chopped down for their
                                    wood. The wood needs to be cut into smaller pieces and processed in such
                                    a way that we can create around 300.000 pencils from a single tree. After
                                    that the wood needs to be filled with graphite, the graphite is mixed with
                                    clay and baked at about 815 deg C. This graphite is sand-witched between
                                    two pieces of our wood, glued and pressed together under a high pressure
                                    ensuring that the parts stay together. These proto-pencils are not painted
                                    but coated with four to ten layers of lacquer. As a last step we add an
                                    eraser, held onto the pencil by a metallic clasp which circles the pencil
                                    and holds the gummy substance in place by gently indenting the metal into
                                    the wood and the gum. This clasp is set with precision, without breaking
                                    the graphite, which is easily broken, and without cracking the wood.</p>
                                <p>I hope that by now you have realized that it is only possible to make
                                    a pencil because of decades of progress and discovery. It took <em>craftsmen</em> centuries
                                    to acquire the skills and discipline needed to craft the materials and
                                    production processes for something as seemingly simple as a pencil.</p>
                                
<h1>How software is made</h1>

                                <p>“There is not a single human being who could create modern software from
                                    scratch!” Imagine that we would lose all technology tomorrow. I can write
                                    code, I’m fairly good at writing code but I would be nothing without a
                                    computer, an IDE and a compiler. The last two I might be able to create
                                    given the first, but a computer is not something I can build. If I’m being
                                    honest, I don’t even fully understand how a processor works. Let me show
                                    you a picture:</p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="./cpu_architecture.png" alt="cpu architecture">
                                </p>
                                <p>Imagine being handed an image like this and being told: “Your sprint backlog
                                    has been updated, you will create the <em>Simple Decoder</em>.” I would
                                    not even know where to start. I’d probably go to a bookstore and get the
                                    highest rated book on CPUs; sit down for a week; read as much as I could;
                                    think I’d have a grasp on the subject and proceed to create the world’s
                                    worst <em>Simple Decoder</em>.s</p>
                                <p>This collaboration is what we are asking of teams. This <em>specific proficiency</em> is
                                    what we are asking of software engineers. We are asking teams to build
                                    a small part of a larger product. Our architectural drawings are the same
                                    as the drawing we just saw of the processor. We expect teams to know what
                                    the drawing means, what role they play in bringing that drawing to life,
                                    all the while being able to steer themselves. What we are asking teams
                                    to do, is to: “Create a small part of a pencil in such a way that we can
                                    mass produce all these parts, bring them together and sell the complete
                                    product to customers.”.</p>
                                <p>Like in the case with the pencils, we are asking teams to be <em>craftsmen</em>.
                                    They need to be proficient in the art of creating software for a specific
                                    domain. This software will be used by other teams to facilitate our business
                                    in automating their processes. To be honest, we are asking a lot of our
                                    teams: becoming a <em>craftsman</em> takes time. Nevertheless, once you’re
                                    starting to near that pinnacle of professionalism, you would not stop even
                                    if you could.</p>
                                
<h1>Craftsmanship</h1>

                                <p>It is difficult to draw a hard line of what an engineer should know and
                                    how we, as an organisation, can best guide them. The closest I’ve come
                                    to hearing a term for this is <em>Craftsmanship</em>. A <em>Craftsman</em> does
                                    not only excel at their skill but they also know how their skill impacts
                                    the world around them. They know what is happening in their field, which
                                    problems it is facing and how to help the next generation of <em>Craftsmen</em> avoid
                                    the mistakes they have made. Being a <em>Software Craftsman</em> is not about
                                    being good at, for example, “writing code” or “testing code”. It is about
                                    being good at “Delivering working software”.</p>
                                <p>Our community is polarised about what it means to “Deliver working software”.
                                    I can help with this debate. I want to postulate that your team is “Delivering
                                    working software” when, tomorrow, everyone can leave and the next team
                                    will have a minimal ramp-up time to continue their work. It is less about
                                    the running software and more about the quality of everything around the
                                    running software.</p>
                                <p>In order to specify the processes which need to be in place to deliver
                                    this kind of continuity, debates like: “Should we use Test Driven Development?”
                                    or: “Should we adopt pair programming and just check in on the master branch?”
                                    stem from. I don’t think there is a single <em>Craftsman</em> who denies
                                    that testing makes their products better. The debate is not about quality,
                                    the debate is about quality compared to speed of delivery. It is a debate
                                    which is grounded in the principals that we want to remove superfluous
                                    processes. More often than not, to the detrement of the software, managers
                                    make decisions which only a true craftsman is able to make.</p>
                                <p>But, this debate is becoming hypothetical. Imagine that pencil and everyone
                                    needed to craft it. Now let’s postulate that tomorrow the experienced people
                                    that know how to make graphite quit; all of them! Would we want the production
                                    of pencils to stop? No, we’d want them to have trained the next generation
                                    of graphite <em>craftsmen</em> to take their place.</p>
                                <p>The same goes for software development. We need every developer to know
                                    how to deliver software. We are building code upon code and system upon
                                    system. We are hooking everything up to the internet, just because we can,
                                    without taking a step back and thinking about the bigger picture of what
                                    we’re creating. We’ll need to start accepting that what we create as software
                                    developers is going to be used by other software developers for a very
                                    long time to come. Realizing this should trigger us to put all our effort
                                    into creating the best software we can and to become true *craftsmen.</p>
                                
<h1>The four pillars of craftsmanship</h1>

                                <p><em>Craftsmanship</em> is built on top of four pillars. In this chapter
                                    I will describe each pillar in detail.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Be curious</li>
                                    <li>Educate peers</li>
                                    <li>Be disciplined</li>
                                    <li>Take ownership</li>
                                </ul>
                                
<h2>Be curious</h2>

                                <p>Curiosity is what drives innovation and improvements. If you are fully
                                    convinced that what you are doing is the most optimal way to do it and
                                    there are no more gains to be achieved; you’ve lost your curiosity. <em>Craftsmen</em> are
                                    never satisfied. They can be proud, they can be stubborn, they can try
                                    to disprove their competition; but they are never satisfied.</p>
                                <p>Within the concept of curiosity lies a form of hope and this is where
                                    I always focus my efforts on. We can detect things which are going wrong
                                    but we should never lose hope. Hope drives us to challenge our status quo
                                    and forces us to think of new and better ways to do what we are already
                                    doing.</p>
                                <p>With hopefulness comes enthusiasm. Hope is infectious, it spreads; but
                                    hope can also be put out. There is the downside to managing curiosity;
                                    if you are not careful you can destroy all curiosity leaving only apathy
                                    and disgruntled employees.</p>
                                <p>If you, as a <em>Craftsman</em>, feel cornered or afraid, if you are not
                                    challenged enough; your hope is the first thing to be put out. If you are
                                    held back and not given the opportunity to see where your mind and skills
                                    take you, your curiosity will be put out.</p>
                                <p>It takes time to light the spark of curiosity, it only takes moments to
                                    snuff it out. A craftsman is curious because they are hopeful and are not
                                    afraid to share that hope. A craftsman knows how to inspire that curiosity
                                    in others, inviting questions, encouraging challenges and rewarding the
                                    fruits of genuine curiosity.</p>
                                
<h2>Educate peers</h2>

                                <p>A craftsman understands that their knowledge is limited and that only
                                    by collaboration, progress is made. We humans are great at recognizing
                                    patterns but not everyone sees the same patterns. This is why education
                                    must come from multiple sources. A true craftsman knows where their weaknesses
                                    lie and will help their apprentices in finding other craftsmen who will
                                    help them fill those gaps, overcome those weaknesses.</p>
                                <p>I hope you all know the saying: “Standing on the shoulders of giants.”
                                    It is true. I have been wrecking my brain to find the opposite of craftsmanship
                                    until a colleague of mine proposed <em>ineptness</em>, another colleague
                                    proposed <em>legacy</em>. Both are right, both words fit and both relay
                                    something different about craftsmanship.</p>
                                <p>Education is the only way to combat ineptness and raise someone up from
                                    being inept to being a craftsman while interaction is the only way to lift
                                    legacy into something new and give hope. It is not only someone’s skill
                                    which makes them a craftsman but also their willingness to help their environment
                                    achieve new levels.</p>
                                
<h2>Be disciplined</h2>

                                <p>It takes time, even for a <em>craftsman</em>, to create something which
                                    works well. In our enthusiasm or because of expectations, promisses and
                                    pressure, we can forget to apply the proper standards to our work, resulting
                                    in something others might find amazing and exceptional but other <em>craftsmen</em> immediately
                                    recognize as being cobbled together. Having the discipline to take the
                                    time and do something well is what separates a <em>craftsman</em> from a
                                    novice.</p>
                                <p>The best analogy I can think of, is that of a writer. Everyone can write,
                                    everyone can string together a few words and hand them to another person
                                    hoping that they’ll infer the correct meaning. Only a <em>craftsman</em> realizes
                                    that it takes discipline to revise and edit, cut and rewrite, until the
                                    words on the page are not only covering their intention but also target
                                    the right audience and it brings them along until the writer's point is
                                    perfectly clear.</p>
                                <p>Writing something is hard. A true <em>craftsman</em> is humble and disciplined
                                    enough to realize when their work is not ready yet and will take advice
                                    and help until it is.</p>
                                <p>Back in the realm of software development we have this same analogy by
                                    looking at code and pull-requests. Even the best developers should be humble
                                    enough to go through the pull-request process, everyone can make mistakes
                                    and by showing your code to other developers and being open to feedback
                                    and questions, everyone can improve. The added benefit is that the <em>running software</em> gets
                                    better.</p>
                                <p>Through discipline and humble interaction, the end-result is improved.</p>
                                
<h2>Take ownership</h2>

                                <p>All this discipline can only be channeled into something productive when
                                    you take ownership. If you are acraftsman, if you are curious, have learned
                                    from the best, are teaching the next generation and are disciplined; you
                                    will <em>want</em> to take ownership. You will feel a sense of pride in what
                                    your produce.</p>
                                <p>Ownership is not something you can force on someone. I will not take ownership
                                    of something I do not believe in. I will refuse to let someone I feel responsible
                                    for, take ownership of something which was created by an individual who
                                    lacks the discipline to create it in the correct way. Ownership is the
                                    ultimate act of confidence. When you take ownership of something you say:
                                    “I believe in this, I will show the world how great it is!”.</p>
                                <p>My general message to organizations is that it is unwise to <em>assign</em> ownership
                                    of something. People need to <em>take</em> ownership and through the act
                                    of taking ownership, promise that they will adhere to their code of conduct,
                                    their discipline when working on that topic. We, as an organization, should
                                    only allow <em>craftsmen</em> to take ownership. If we allow the inept to
                                    take ownership we are in for a world of trouble. Their great intentions
                                    will set us back more than if we had not created that piece of software
                                    in the first place.</p>
                                
<h1>Conclusion</h1>

                                <p>Software, like pencils, can only be developed, improved an brought to
                                    the next level thanks to <em>Craftsmen</em>. <em>Craftsmanship</em> is the
                                    process of rigorously applying discipline to a problem until you are proud
                                    of the result and are willing to take ownership of that result. A <em>craftsmen</em> realizes
                                    that they cannot do it alone and will actively seek out, learn from and
                                    train other people. They will collaborate with their peers until there
                                    is a community of like-minded <em>craftsmen</em> challenging each other and
                                    continuously improving each other.</p>
                                <p>A <em>craftsman</em> realizes that they are not the alpha and the omega
                                    of a topic. They realize that they, purely by the fact that they came before,
                                    will be one of the shoulders on which the next generation will stand. A <em>craftsman</em> is
                                    content in the fact that their skills, their discipline and their teaching
                                    will move their field forward.</p>
                                <p>I am a technical fellow at Essent. I teach, I train and I help. My role
                                    is as much a detector of ineptness as it is an instigator of improvements
                                    through interaction. I take this seriously but I realize that I am not
                                    at the center of our journey towards <em>craftsmanship</em>. For me, being
                                    a technical fellow is about embodying the four pillars of <em>craftsmanship</em> and
                                    with my effort inspire the next generation of incredible engineers at Essent.</p>
