                                <h1>Storytelling</h1>

                                <p>Kobe Bryant, arguably one of the top ten basketball players to have ever
                                    played the game, was a tremendous story teller. If you have ever seen one
                                    of his interviews you'll know how much impact his words have had on a generation
                                    of basketball players. Storytelling is what drives our imagination; storytelling
                                    is what took our species from being tribes trying to survive by gathering
                                    and hunting our food to a species on the cusp of interplanetary space travel.</p>
                                <p>We, as a species, see patterns. Patterns to help us distinguish a snake
                                    from a branch or patterns which help us detect early stage cancer from
                                    a blurry black and white image covering a well lit background in a doctor's
                                    office. Storytelling gives us a way to fill other people's minds with discernible
                                    patterns and guide them to a realization which had otherwise not occurred.
                                    A good story will help you communicate your goals and your values, through
                                    a good narrative you can help everyone work towards a common goal. Like
                                    with almost everything in life, a good story is incredibly important when
                                    creating software. It is really hard to get 200 developers to create functioning
                                    software without aligning your goals, a good narrative is crucial to this
                                    endeavor.</p>
                                <p>This story is not about Kobe Bryant, this story is about how we as an
                                    architecture community must focus on the <em>story</em> we are trying to
                                    tell. Architects are very good at finding and exploring patterns, but a
                                    pattern is not something we can convince someone of, or sell to the business.
                                    A pattern is just that, a set of seeming similarities which might be abstracted
                                    and given a name. A story is what brings the need for these patterns to
                                    light. We should not skip the story, just so that we can spoil the ending.
                                    This article will show you how our habits and our tools cause us to miss
                                    most of the story and because of that, deliver software which could be
                                    a lot better.</p>
                                
<h2>Diagrams vs Stories</h2>

                                <p>One of our most important languages, as architects, is ArchiMate. We tend
                                    to use it to tell our story. Our focus on ArchiMate and the tools implementing
                                    the ArchiMate language, muddy the story which we are trying to tell with
                                    our software. A diagram is not a story, a diagram might be a picture used
                                    to bring a scenario to life, but it can never be the story by itself.</p>
                                <p>The ArchiMate language is maintained by the Open Group. To quote the Open
                                    Group's website: &quot;The Open Group is a global consortium that enables
                                    the achievement of business objectives through technology standards.&quot;
                                    They publish a modeling language called <em>ArchiMate</em> which can be used
                                    to generate consistent architecture diagrams. The following definition
                                    of what the ArchiMate specification is can be found on their website:</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>The ArchiMate Specification provides a common language and elements to
                                        enable enterprise, business, solution and technology architects, business
                                        analysts and modelers, and software engineers to describe, analyze, and
                                        visualize the relationships among business domains in an unambiguous way.
                                        - ArchiMate, Open Group</p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>If the goal of the Open Group is to enable us, to achieve business objectives,
                                    then why do they not focus on storytelling? Are we to assume that a diagram
                                    1 really triggers our imagination? Let alone our understanding? Where have
                                    we described the business objectives themselves so that others will understand
                                    what our diagram describes? Without a narrative supporting the diagram
                                    we will never achieve our goals.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="./archimate_example_001.png" alt="archimate_example_001.png">
                                </p>
                                <p>When we see an image like the Archimate example our brains go into overdrive
                                    and we start looking for patterns. For some reason the yellow blocks are
                                    at the top. Some seem to have more rounded corners than others and still
                                    others seem to look 3d instead of being 2d. Wow, there are different arrows.</p>
                                <p>ArchiMate tries to combat this natural reaction of our brains by setting
                                    up rules and definitions. Like every intellectual worth their salt the
                                    Open Group started whittling away at their problem space by writing down
                                    what the arrows, icons and corners mean. From the entire set of possibilities
                                    they defined their way to something they think is reasonable. But what
                                    happens next? John, from upstairs, really needs a <em>business capability</em> to
                                    be implemented through a certain <em>data object</em> by a <em>component</em>,
                                    and before we realize it we have a committee bloating our language with
                                    exceptions and clarifications.</p>
                                <p>This is, of course, an over-simplification of what happens; but the gist
                                    stands, nothing in the ArchiMate language is <em>axiomatic</em>, everything
                                    is an interpretation and because the storytelling surrounding the rules
                                    put forth by the Open Group is lacking at best, we end up with a set of
                                    rules people need to <em>learn by heart</em> in order to have a chance at
                                    understanding the diagrams individuals create.</p>
                                <p>It is safe to assume that we now understand why none of the large <em>tech-companies</em> bother
                                    using tools like <em>Archi</em> or <em>Enterprise Architect</em> by Sparx,
                                    in their day to day development. Other types of organizations still use
                                    these tools and as a consequence the gap between architecture and development
                                    has never been bigger. To make matters worse, every five years we get a
                                    paradigm which is a <em>silver bullet</em>. It might be <em>Functional Programming</em> or
                                    it might be <em>Cloud</em>. It does not matter if it is a framework, a language
                                    or an infrastructure. With a lack of a common sense architecture we are
                                    faced with a plethora of choices regarding our development strategies and
                                    the implementation of our stories.</p>
                                <p><em>Micro-services</em>, for example, are a way of thinking about a solution.
                                    They are patterns, guidelines and best practices shared with us by inventors.
                                    They are <em>tools</em> without a story. Not every story leads to a <em>micro-service architecture</em> and
                                    not every story needs the <em>Interface Segregation Principle</em>. It is
                                    true that once you are bringing your story to life like a director bringing
                                    a play to the stage, you'll have a certain freedom to choreograph your
                                    story. At the root of the implementation, however, remains the story.</p>
                                
<h1>Storytelling within Architecture</h1>

                                <p><em>Effective storytelling</em> will save us from the day to day chaos
                                    of large enterprises; let me explain why, but like every good story we
                                    will need to start at a beginning:</p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>As a consumer I would like to see how much electricity or gas I have consumed
                                        in the last month. - Essent Customer</p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>There, our story begins. There is no need for diagrams, there is no need
                                    for rules or definitions, there is just plain language. With these simple
                                    words our brains can start finding patters; we can start finding truths
                                    within this statement and we can grow our understanding by talking to other
                                    people and sharing our patterns and assumptions with each other. Our tribal
                                    instincts can be met by human to human interaction. This storytelling,
                                    at least for me, is at the heart of <em>Domain Driven Design</em>. And I
                                    personally define a <em>Domain</em> as: &quot;An area of expertise I can
                                    fit into my brain.&quot;</p>
                                <p>But, how can we create software if we just have a story? We will need
                                    something we can validate, we can test, we can deploy and which we can
                                    take ownership of and maintain.</p>
                                <p>Yes, this is true, but we will need to crawl before we can walk and we'll
                                    need to walk before we can run. A child needs to feel safe to get the grounding
                                    they need to face the challenges of life. Software is the same, if we do
                                    not feel safe in our assumptions, if we do not feel confident in our skills
                                    and if we do not trust our architects to work with us; we will never achieve
                                    the level of software we will need to lift our business to a higher level.</p>
                                
<h2>Start-ups vs Enterprises</h2>

                                <p>Let us dive into a tangent; why do start-ups fail? And, why do certain
                                    start-ups surpass larger enterprises? An <em>Enterprise</em> should have
                                    the money to outlast the competition, right? An <em>Enterprise</em> should
                                    have the money to look around, hire the best people and quickly integrate
                                    great ideas into their own production, right? The answer lies in <em>storytelling</em>.
                                    An <em>Enterprise</em> has hierarchy which means that the story can become
                                    fragmented and corrupted. Within an <em>Enterprise</em> a lot of focus and
                                    time is spent on <em>aligning ideas</em>, which is nothing more than: &quot;Getting
                                    your story straight.&quot; When hierarchy comes into play, the story of
                                    someone does not fit the overall narrative but is forced onto the narrative
                                    by reasons other than cohesion. Hierarchy is used when the story needs
                                    to be changed but the actors and actresses do not understand or sanction
                                    the changes. If it were otherwise, the story would just unfold and there
                                    would be no need for hierarchical decisions.</p>
                                <p>Start-ups are smaller, usually run by an <em>enlightened despot</em>. They
                                    have a single narrative, a single story and everyone knows the story. There
                                    is no ambiguity within the story, no doubt, no fragility and no conflicting
                                    message; there is only the story. But, they do fail, a lot. Just because
                                    the narrative is strong and unambiguous, does not mean that the story is
                                    good or that the story is gripping. There are plenty of books which I do
                                    not care to read but the ones which gripped me have never left me.</p>
                                
<h2>Our story continues...</h2>

                                <p>From our story we can distill that we have concepts like: “consumption”,
                                    “electricity” and “consumer”. These story concepts will need to find a
                                    place in our architecture. If we follow the breadcrumbs left by our story,
                                    we will start to figure out the sequence in which the events of our story
                                    take place.</p>
                                <p>Our story starts with a consumer, consuming, electricity or gas. In this
                                    part we set up the actors in our story, we describe how they interact,
                                    what motivates our actors and what limits them. Clearly these actors need
                                    something; or there would not be a story to write. Instead of saying: “A
                                    consumer consumes electricity.” we might write something like: “Winter
                                    is coming! An unexpected cold front will hit our lovely country with a
                                    fierceness which has been unparalleled for the last twenty years. Anna
                                    feels the cold seep through her walls and turns on her central heating
                                    which is powered by heating water through the burning of gas. This heating
                                    consumes gas at an initial flow rate of per hour. This of course is only
                                    in times when it is cold. During the summer the consumption of gas might
                                    even drop to 0.” This story is starting to help us understand what “consumption”
                                    actually is and why it is important for us to show it to Anna.</p>
                                <p>To further help us understand this process we might want to draw an additional
                                    diagram:</p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="./retrieve_consumption.png" alt="retrieve_consumption.png">
                                </p>
                                <p>Our diagram describes the preceded story in a different way. We do this
                                    because everyone sees patterns differently. Some people see images and
                                    lines between images and with that they form a story in their minds. Some
                                    people do not see anything but lines and blocks and cannot read the story
                                    from these lines. To be honest, not many people can. The ability to abstract
                                    something into blocks and lines is not that common; but the ability to
                                    go from an abstraction back to the actual story is something I have seen
                                    even less.</p>
                                <p>This is where tools like Archi and Enterprise Architect fall short. They
                                    do not tell a story. They help people organise their mind in lines and
                                    blocks but leave a project unattended for a year, maybe two and put a different
                                    architect on the project and you will probably hear the famous words: “This
                                    is wrong, I will have to re-do everything!” This of course is the famous
                                    mantra of the engineer and it is due to the fact that the story is not
                                    clear. It is why projects fail, it is why turn-over is such a destructive
                                    force in a company; to be fair, it is why gilded-cages were invented.</p>
                                
<h1>Agile Architecture</h1>

                                <p>Have you ever tried &quot;Cooperative Writing&quot;? It is when you write
                                    a story together. Let me tell you, it is hard. Your plot will change in
                                    ways you did not expect but the result can be beautiful. Let's think of
                                    ways to make cooperative writing easier. We could give an outline per chapter;
                                    describing the start and the end of the chapter, leaving everything else
                                    free to be imagined by the writer writing the chapter itself.</p>
                                <p>This is exactly what we do when we create software. The architect creates
                                    an outline of what needs to be done. <em>Component A should take the meter readings and calculate the consumption of a customer.</em> Again,
                                    there is no need for diagrams. What this sentence does not tell you is <em>how</em> we
                                    need to deliver this story, but a combination of different diagrams might
                                    give us what we need. We might use a <em>flow</em> diagram to show the interaction
                                    with other components. We might use a <em>logical data model</em> to explain
                                    the data or information needed in the story.</p>
                                
<h1>How we save Architecture</h1>

                                <p>If we, as a society, want to ensure that we retain the knowledge we have
                                    built over the last 500 years; we will need to become better at telling
                                    stories. We will need to train the same skill as our ancestors trained
                                    and sit together to thrill, entertain and bring people together. Our stories
                                    unite us as much as our software does. Just imagine 500 years from now,
                                    what will they remember from this time? Our ArchiMate diagrams? Or the
                                    stories we've written in which the core of our humanity and our human endeavors
                                    are cataloged?</p>
                                <p>I do not fault the Open Group for pushing their standards, I do not fault
                                    the architecture community for following them. I just ask everyone, business
                                    and IT alike to start communicating in stories before building a single
                                    piece of software. After the story is told and everyone can tell it to
                                    their, children, wives, neighbors and basketball friends; than it is time
                                    to start writing your first <em>unit test</em>. In the order of things,
                                    the story must come first.</p>
