# Yet another blog engine?

Why would anyone, in 2022, write their own blog engine? This is a fair question. Most people when they think about a blog engine, think about something like *[Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)*, *[medium.com](https://medium.com)* or *[gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)*.

When I think about a blog engine I think about: 

 * Content Ownership
 * Reliability
 * Lineage of the content

Creating a system which takes these things into account is extremely important to me, this is why I've created *swarm*. *Swarm* is a blog engine which takes one or multiple git repositories, merges and bundles the content into a single output repository which can easily be hosted.

## Choosing a programming language

The first choice I had to make was the choice of a programming language. I personally love C#, it's my favorite language because it can do everything.
