description: Each Friday is Techlab Day. We spend half of the Techlab days at the office and half of them online. We always start the day with a stand-up, in our Techlab room on our Techlab Slack channel. During the stand we check out the different projects we are currently working on. Everyone discusses what they plan to do today, and if someone is done with a project, we choose together the next topic we should start working on. We work on projects both individually, in couples and as a team.

# Each Friday is Techlab Day

Our way-of-working is quite simple: Each Friday is Techlab Day. We spend half of the Techlab days at the office and half of them online. We always start the day with a stand-up, in our Techlab room on our Techlab Slack channel. During the stand we check out the different projects we are currently working on. Everyone discusses what they plan to do today, and if someone is done with a project, we choose together the next topic we should start working on. We work on projects both individually, in couples and as a team. Sometimes we plan a brainstorm session to discuss different technologies and project ideas before we decide what to work on. After the stand-up, everyone starts working on their tasks. When we have an office day, we always go have lunch together in the city. The Essent Office is really close to the city centre of Den Bosch, and we are still trying out which diner serves the best tosti’s in town. After lunch we continue working on our projects and have meetings in case we need each other’s help to make progress. We end the day with a day closing: everyone shares what they did throughout the day, and we update the Trello board accordingly. On Office days, we often follow up the day closing with drinks at café Buurt only a few steps away from office. A great way to start the weekend!
