                                <p>Our way-of-working is quite simple: Each Friday is Techlab Day. We spend
                                    half of the Techlab days at the office and half of them online. We always
                                    start the day with a stand-up, in our Techlab room on our Techlab Slack
                                    channel. During the stand we check out the different projects we are currently
                                    working on. Everyone discusses what they plan to do today, and if someone
                                    is done with a project, we choose together the next topic we should start
                                    working on. We work on projects both individually, in couples and as a
                                    team. Sometimes we plan a brainstorm session to discuss different technologies
                                    and project ideas before we decide what to work on. After the stand-up,
                                    everyone starts working on their tasks. When we have an office day, we
                                    always go have lunch together in the city. The Essent Office is really
                                    close to the city centre of Den Bosch, and we are still trying out which
                                    diner serves the best tosti’s in town. After lunch we continue working
                                    on our projects and have meetings in case we need each other’s help to
                                    make progress. We end the day with a day closing: everyone shares what
                                    they did throughout the day, and we update the Trello board accordingly.
                                    On Office days, we often follow up the day closing with drinks at café
                                    Buurt only a few steps away from office. A great way to start the weekend!</p>
