# POC’s and POT’s

How do we select and work on projects? Our main focus is trying out new and innovative technologies. There are two ways ideas for new projects come to us:

 1. We spot a new technology which we find interesting and try to find ways in which this technology can be useful for Essent.
 1. A business case comes to our attention, and we try to find new technologies which could be useful in this specific use case.

When a technology is selected based on one of the above ways, we research the technology and set up a Proof-of-Concept (POC) or Proof-of-Technology (POT). This can lead to several outcomes: the POC can be successful, in which case we give advice to the business on how to further implement the technology. Or the POC failed, and we cannot make the technology work. Another option is the POC was successful, but we do not see added value here. In this case we advise the business to find a different solution. What is important to know is that the scope of Techlab ends after the advice: we do not fully implement solutions or execute maintenance after implementation. This is the responsibility of the business unit which will use the technology. Of course, we are always happy to help out if needed.

In our next post on this channel, we will share an example of a POT/POC we’re working on! Want to share your experiences with selecting innovative technology? Please leave a message. See you next Friday!
