# What/Who is Techlab?

Techlab is a team of (currently) four DevOps engineers from across ARTs and one management trainee working together on innovative projects. Every team member works for a different team on “regular” days, but on Fridays we come together to work as the Techlab. The goal of the Techlab is to experiment with new technologies to improve our (current) business model and processes and to increase personal development opportunities.

So, who is currently part of the Techlab team? From left to right we are Eva, Panos, Niels, Hannah and Ekta. So, let’s introduce ourselves!

Hannah is the Techlab Lead and has been part of Techlab the longest. She works as a front-end DevOps engineer in the I Use FE team in the Believers ART. Within Techlab, she works on projects just like the other engineers, but also leads the Techlab by organizing the Techlab days, networking with colleagues in- and outside of Essent and making sure we stay true to our mission. Panos and Ekta are engineers from the same DevOps team as Hannah, and Niels is an engineer from the Siterocks team in the Changers ART. The three of them work on both individual and group projects for Techlab and use their creative minds to come up with and execute great POCs of new technologies. Eva is the management trainee of Essent IT and works on several projects throughout her traineeship, like sharing content on this platform.
