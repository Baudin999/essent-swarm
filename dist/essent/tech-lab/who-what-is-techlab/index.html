                                <h1>What/Who is Techlab?</h1>

                                <p>Techlab is a team of (currently) four DevOps engineers from across ARTs
                                    and one management trainee working together on innovative projects. Every
                                    team member works for a different team on “regular” days, but on Fridays
                                    we come together to work as the Techlab. The goal of the Techlab is to
                                    experiment with new technologies to improve our (current) business model
                                    and processes and to increase personal development opportunities.</p>
                                <p>So, who is currently part of the Techlab team? From left to right we are
                                    Eva, Panos, Niels, Hannah and Ekta. So, let’s introduce ourselves!</p>
                                <p>Hannah is the Techlab Lead and has been part of Techlab the longest. She
                                    works as a front-end DevOps engineer in the I Use FE team in the Believers
                                    ART. Within Techlab, she works on projects just like the other engineers,
                                    but also leads the Techlab by organizing the Techlab days, networking with
                                    colleagues in- and outside of Essent and making sure we stay true to our
                                    mission. Panos and Ekta are engineers from the same DevOps team as Hannah,
                                    and Niels is an engineer from the Siterocks team in the Changers ART. The
                                    three of them work on both individual and group projects for Techlab and
                                    use their creative minds to come up with and execute great POCs of new
                                    technologies. Eva is the management trainee of Essent IT and works on several
                                    projects throughout her traineeship, like sharing content on this platform.</p>
