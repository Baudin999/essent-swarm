If you have ever seen his interviews you’ll know how much impact his words have had on a generation of basketball players. Storytelling is what drives our imagination; storytelling is what took our species from tribes trying to survive by gathering and hunting our food to a species on the cusp of interplanetary space travel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We, as a species, see patterns. Patterns to help us distinguish a snake from a branch or patterns which help us detect early stage cancer from a blurry black and white image covering a well lit background in a doctor’s office. Storytelling gives us a way to supply other people’s minds with discernible patterns and guide them to a realization which had otherwise not occurred. A good story will help you communicate your goals and your values, through a good narrative you can help everyone work towards a common goal. A good story is incredibly important when creating software. It is really hard to get 200 developers to create functioning software without aligning your goals, a good narrative is crucial to this endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this document I will go over the ideas and concepts within good storytelling, which can help us create better Enterprise Architecture. Architects are very good at finding patterns and applying them to real world problems; but one of their pitfalls is that they tend to skip the story just so that they can read the ending. This document will try to show you how our habits and our tools cause us to miss most of the story and because of that deliver software which could be a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Diagrams vs Stories&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of our most important tools as architects; one of the tools through which most of our storytelling happens is ArchiMate. In my opinion, our focus on ArchiMate and the tools implementing the ArchiMate language muddy the story which we are trying to tell with our software. The ArchiMate language is maintained by the Open Group.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To quote the Open Group’s website: “The Open Group is a global consortium that enables the achievement of business objectives through technology standards.” They publish a modeling language called ArchiMate which can be used to generate consistent architecture diagrams. The following definition of the what the ArchiMate specification is can be found on their website:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The ArchiMate Specification provides a common language and elements to enable enterprise, business, solution and technology architects, business analysts and modelers, and software engineers to describe, analyze, and visualize the relationships among business domains in an unambiguous way. - ArchiMate, Open Group&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If the goal of the Open Group is to enable us, to achieve business objectives, then why do they not focus on storytelling? Are we to assume that a diagram 1 really triggers our imagination? Let alone our understanding? Where have we described the business objectives themselves so that others will understand what our diagram describes? Without a narrative supporting the diagram we will never achieve our goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;./archimate_example_001.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;archimate_example_001.png\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When we see an image like the Archimate example our brains go into overdrive and we start looking for patterns. For some reason the yellow blocks are at the top. Some seem to have more rounded corners than others and still others seem to look 3d instead of being 2d. Wow, there are different arrows!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ArchiMate tries to combat this natural reaction of our brains by setting up rules and definitions. Like every intellectual worth their salt the Open Group started whittling away at their problem space by writing down what the arrows, icons and corners mean. From the entire set of possibilities they defined their way to something they think is reasonable. But what happens next? John, from upstairs, really needs a business capability to be implemented through a certain data object by a component, and before we realize it we have a committee bloating our language with exceptions and clarifications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, an over-simplification of what happens; but the gist stands, nothing in the ArchiMate language is axiomatic1, everything is an interpretation and because the storytelling surrounding the rules put forth by the Open Group is lacking at best, we end up with a set of rules people need to learn by heart in order to have a chance at understanding the diagrams individuals create.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In my opinion it is safe to assume that we now understand why none of the large tech-companies bother using tools like Archi or Enterprise Architect by Sparx in their day to day development and as a consequence the gap between architecture and development has never been this big. To make matters worse, every five years we get a paradigm which is a silver bullet. It might be Clean Code and the SOLID principles, Functional Programming or it might be microservices. With a lack of common sense architecture we are faced with a plethora of choices regarding our development strategies and the implementation of our stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Micro-services, for example, are a way of thinking about a solution. They are patterns, guidelines and best practices shared with us by inventors. They are tools without a story. Not every story leads to a micro-service architecture and not every story needs the Interface Segregation Principle. It is true that once you are bringing your story to life like a director bringing a play to the stage, you’ll have a certain freedom to choreograph your story. But at the root of the implementation lies the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Like a good director, an architect can bring a story to life. They can cast the right actor for the role. They can choose to change a paragraph because it adds more gravitas to the situation. Architects bake the bread from the ingredients given to them by inventors and visionaries but the fact that the bread is needed is solely dependent on the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Storytelling within Architecture&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I believe that effective storytelling can save us from the day to day chaos of large enterprises; let me explain why but like every good story we will need to start at a beginning:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a consumer I would like to see how much electricity or gas I have consumed in the last month. - Essent Customer&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There, our story begins. I do not need diagrams, I do not need rules or definitions, I just need plain language. With these simple words our brains can start finding patters; we can start finding truths within this statement and we can grow our understanding by talking to other people and sharing our patterns and assumptions with each other. Our tribal instincts can be met by human to human interaction. I might be completely wrong, but this storytelling, at least for me, is at the heart of Domain Driven Design. And I personally define a Domain as: &amp;quot;An area of expertise I can fit into my brain.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But, how can we create software if we just have a story? We will need something we can validate, we can test, we can deploy and which we can take ownership of and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is true, but we will need to crawl before we can walk and we&#x27;ll need to walk before we can run. A child needs to feel safe to get the grounding they need to face the challenges of life. Software is the same, if we do not feel safe in our assumptions, if we do not feel confident in our skills and if we do not trust our architects to work with us; we will never achieve the level of software we will need to lift our business to a higher level.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Start-ups vs Enterprises&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let us dive into a tangent; why do start-ups fail? And, why do certain start-ups surpass larger enterprises? An Enterprise should have the money to outlast the competition, right? An Enterprise should have the money to look around, hire the best people and quickly integrate great ideas into their own production, right? The answer lies in storytelling. An Enterprise has hierarchy which means that the story can become fragmented and corrupted. Within an Enterprise a lot of focus and time is spent on aligning ideas, which is nothing more than: “Getting your story straight.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When hierarchy comes into play, the story of someone does not fit the overall narrative but is forced onto the narrative by reasons other than cohesion. Hierarchy is used when the story needs to be changed but the actors and actresses do not understand or sanction the changes. If it were otherwise, the story would just unfold and there would be no need for hierarchical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Start-ups are smaller, usually run by an enlightened despot. They have a single narrative, a single story and everyone knows the story. There is no ambiguity within the story, no doubt, no fragility and no conflicting message; there is only the story. But, they do fail, a lot. Just because the narrative is strong and unambiguous, does not mean that the story is good or that the story is gripping. There are plenty of books which I do not care to read but the ones which gripped me have never left me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Our story continues...&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From our story we can distill that we have concepts like: “consumption”, “electricity” and “consumer”. These story concepts will need to find a place in our architecture. If we follow the breadcrumbs left by our story, we will start to figure out the sequence in which the events of our story take place.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our story starts with a consumer, consuming, electricity or gas. In this part we set up the actors in our story, we describe how they interact, what motivates our actors and what limits them. Clearly these actors need something; or there would not be a story to write. Instead of saying: “A consumer consumes electricity.” we might write something like: “Winter is coming! An unexpected cold front will hit our lovely country with a fierceness which has been unparalleled for the last twenty years. Anna feels the cold seep through her walls and turns on her central heating which is powered by heating water through the burning of gas. This heating consumes gas at an initial flow rate of  per hour. This of course is only in times when it is cold. During the summer the consumption of gas might even drop to 0.” This story is starting to help us understand what “consumption” actually is and why it is important for us to show it to Anna.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To further help us understand this process we might want to draw an additional diagram:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;./retrieve_consumption.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;retrieve_consumption.png\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our diagram describes the preceded story in a different way. We do this because everyone sees patterns differently. Some people see images and lines between images and with that they form a story in their minds. Some people do not see anything but lines and blocks and cannot read the story from these lines. To be honest, not many people can. The ability to abstract something into blocks and lines is not that common; but the ability to go from an abstraction back to the actual story is something I have seen even less.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is where tools like Archi and Enterprise Architect fall short. They do not tell a story. They help people organise their mind in lines and blocks but leave a project unattended for a year, maybe two and put a different architect on the project and you will probably hear the famous words: “This is wrong, I will have to re-do everything!” This of course is the famous mantra of the engineer and it is due to the fact that the story is not clear. It is why projects fail, it is why turn-over is such a destructive force in a company; to be fair, it is why gilded-cages were invented.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;How we save Architecture&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If we, as a society, want to ensure that we retain the knowledge we have built over the last 500 years; we will need to become better at telling stories. We will need to train the same skill as our ancestors trained and sit together to thrill, entertain and bring their peers together. Our stories unite us as much as our software does. Just imagine 500 years from now, what will they remember from this time? Our ArchiMate diagrams? Or the stories we’ve written in which the core of our humanity and our human endeavors are cataloged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I do not fault the Open Group for pushing their standards, I do not fault the architecture community for following them. I just ask everyone, business and IT alike to start communicating in stories before building a single piece of software. After the story is told and everyone can tell it to their families, children, wives, neighbors; than it is time to start writing your first unit test. In the order of things, the story must come first.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;

                        &quot;html&quot;: &quot;&lt;h1&gt;How a pencil is made&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“There is not a single human being who could make a modern pencil from scratch!” This is a bold statement and a true one. A pencil consists of so many parts that there is not a single person in the world who could do it by themselves. There trees which needs to be chopped down for their wood. The wood needs to be cut into smaller pieces and processed in such a way that we can create around 300.000 pencils from a single tree. After that the wood needs to be filled with graphite, the graphite is mixed with clay and baked at about 815 deg C. This graphite is sand-witched between two pieces of our wood, glued and pressed together under a high pressure ensuring that the parts stay together. These proto-pencils are not painted but coated with four to ten layers of lacquer. As a last step we add an eraser, held onto the pencil by a metallic clasp which circles the pencil and holds the gummy substance in place by gently indenting the metal into the wood and the gum. This clasp is set with precision, without breaking the graphite, which is easily broken, and without cracking the wood.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hope that by now you have realized that it is only possible to make a pencil because of decades of progress and discovery. It took &lt;em&gt;craftsmen&lt;/em&gt; centuries to acquire the skills and discipline needed to craft the materials and production processes for something as seemingly simple as a pencil.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;How software is made&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“There is not a single human being who could create modern software from scratch!” Imagine that we would lose all technology tomorrow. I can write code, I’m fairly good at writing code but I would be nothing without a computer, an IDE and a compiler. The last two I might be able to create given the first, but a computer is not something I can build. If I’m being honest, I don’t even fully understand how a processor works. Let me show you a picture:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;./cpu_architecture.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;cpu architecture\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine being handed an image like this and being told: “Your sprint backlog has been updated, you will create the &lt;em&gt;Simple Decoder&lt;/em&gt;.” I would not even know where to start. I’d probably go to a bookstore and get the highest rated book on CPUs; sit down for a week; read as much as I could; think I’d have a grasp on the subject and proceed to create the world’s worst &lt;em&gt;Simple Decoder&lt;/em&gt;.s&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This collaboration is what we are asking of teams. This &lt;em&gt;specific proficiency&lt;/em&gt; is what we are asking of software engineers. We are asking teams to build a small part of a larger product. Our architectural drawings are the same as the drawing we just saw of the processor. We expect teams to know what the drawing means, what role they play in bringing that drawing to life, all the while being able to steer themselves. What we are asking teams to do, is to: “Create a small part of a pencil in such a way that we can mass produce all these parts, bring them together and sell the complete product to customers.”.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Like in the case with the pencils, we are asking teams to be &lt;em&gt;craftsmen&lt;/em&gt;. They need to be proficient in the art of creating software for a specific domain. This software will be used by other teams to facilitate our business in automating their processes. To be honest, we are asking a lot of our teams: becoming a &lt;em&gt;craftsman&lt;/em&gt; takes time.  Nevertheless, once you’re starting to near that pinnacle of professionalism, you would not stop even if you could.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Craftsmanship&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to draw a hard line of what an engineer should know and how we, as an organisation, can best guide them. The closest I’ve come to hearing a term for this is &lt;em&gt;Craftsmanship&lt;/em&gt;. A &lt;em&gt;Craftsman&lt;/em&gt; does not only excel at their skill but they also know how their skill impacts the world around them. They know what is happening in their field, which problems it is facing and how to help the next generation of &lt;em&gt;Craftsmen&lt;/em&gt; avoid the mistakes they have made. Being a &lt;em&gt;Software Craftsman&lt;/em&gt; is not about being good at, for example, “writing code” or “testing code”. It is about being good at “Delivering working software”.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our community is polarised about what it means to “Deliver working software”. I can help with this debate. I want to postulate that your team is “Delivering working software” when, tomorrow, everyone can leave and the next team will have a minimal ramp-up time to continue their work. It is less about the running software and more about the quality of everything around the running software.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In order to specify the processes which need to be in place to deliver this kind of continuity, debates like: “Should we use Test Driven Development?” or: “Should we adopt pair programming and just check in on the master branch?” stem from. I don’t think there is a single &lt;em&gt;Craftsman&lt;/em&gt; who denies that testing makes their products better. The debate is not about quality, the debate is about quality compared to speed of delivery. It is a debate which is grounded in the principals that we want to remove superfluous processes. More often than not, to the detrement of the software, managers make decisions which only a true craftsman is able to make.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But, this debate is becoming hypothetical. Imagine that pencil and everyone needed to craft it. Now let’s postulate that tomorrow the experienced people that know how to make graphite quit; all of them! Would we want the production of pencils to stop? No, we’d want them to have trained the next generation of graphite &lt;em&gt;craftsmen&lt;/em&gt; to take their place.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The same goes for software development. We need every developer to know how to deliver software. We are building code upon code and system upon system. We are hooking everything up to the internet, just because we can, without taking a step back and thinking about the bigger picture of what we’re creating. We’ll need to start accepting that what we create as software developers is going to be used by other software developers for a very long time to come. Realizing this should trigger us to put all our effort into creating the best software we can and to become true *craftsmen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;The four pillars of craftsmanship&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Craftsmanship&lt;/em&gt; is built on top of four pillars. In this chapter I will describe each pillar in detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be curious&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Educate peers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be disciplined&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take ownership&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Be curious&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Curiosity is what drives innovation and improvements. If you are fully convinced that what you are doing is the most optimal way to do it and there are no more gains to be achieved; you’ve lost your curiosity. &lt;em&gt;Craftsmen&lt;/em&gt; are never satisfied. They can be proud, they can be stubborn, they can try to disprove their competition; but they are never satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within the concept of curiosity lies a form of hope and this is where I always focus my efforts on. We can detect things which are going wrong but we should never lose hope. Hope drives us to challenge our status quo and forces us to think of new and better ways to do what we are already doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With hopefulness comes enthusiasm. Hope is infectious, it spreads; but hope can also be put out. There is the downside to managing curiosity; if you are not careful you can destroy all curiosity leaving only apathy and disgruntled employees.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you, as a &lt;em&gt;Craftsman&lt;/em&gt;, feel cornered or afraid, if you are not challenged enough; your hope is the first thing to be put out. If you are held back and not given the opportunity to see where your mind and skills take you, your curiosity will be put out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It takes time to light the spark of curiosity, it only takes moments to snuff it out.\nA craftsman is curious because they are hopeful and are not afraid to share that hope. A craftsman knows how to inspire that curiosity in others, inviting questions, encouraging challenges and rewarding the fruits of genuine curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Educate peers&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A craftsman understands that their knowledge is limited and that only by collaboration, progress is made. We humans are great at recognizing patterns but not everyone sees the same patterns. This is why education must come from multiple sources. A true craftsman knows where their weaknesses lie and will help their apprentices in finding other craftsmen who will help them fill those gaps, overcome those weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you all know the saying: “Standing on the shoulders of giants.” It is true. I have been wrecking my brain to find the opposite of craftsmanship until a colleague of mine proposed &lt;em&gt;ineptness&lt;/em&gt;, another colleague proposed &lt;em&gt;legacy&lt;/em&gt;. Both are right, both words fit and both relay something different about craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Education is the only way to combat ineptness and raise someone up from being inept to being a craftsman while interaction is the only way to lift legacy into something new and give hope. It is not only someone’s skill which makes them a craftsman but also their willingness to help their environment achieve new levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Be disciplined&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It takes time, even for a &lt;em&gt;craftsman&lt;/em&gt;, to create something which works well. In our enthusiasm or because of expectations, promisses and pressure, we can forget to apply the proper standards to our work, resulting in something others might find amazing and exceptional but other &lt;em&gt;craftsmen&lt;/em&gt; immediately recognize as being cobbled together.\nHaving the discipline to take the time and do something well is what separates a &lt;em&gt;craftsman&lt;/em&gt; from a novice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The best analogy I can think of, is that of a writer. Everyone can write, everyone can string together a few words and hand them to another person hoping that they’ll infer the correct meaning. Only a &lt;em&gt;craftsman&lt;/em&gt; realizes that it takes discipline to revise and edit, cut and rewrite, until the words on the page are not only covering their intention but also target the right audience and it brings them along until the writer&#x27;s point is perfectly clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Writing something is hard. A true &lt;em&gt;craftsman&lt;/em&gt; is humble and disciplined enough to realize when their work is not ready yet and will take advice and help until it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Back in the realm of software development we have this same analogy by looking at code and pull-requests. Even the best developers should be humble enough to go through the pull-request process, everyone can make mistakes and by showing your code to other developers and being open to feedback and questions, everyone can improve. The added benefit is that the &lt;em&gt;running software&lt;/em&gt; gets better.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Through discipline and humble interaction, the end-result is improved.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Take ownership&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All this discipline can only be channeled into something productive when you take ownership. If you are acraftsman, if you are curious, have learned from the best, are teaching the next generation and are disciplined; you will &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to take ownership. You will feel a sense of pride in what your produce.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ownership is not something you can force on someone. I will not take ownership of something I do not believe in. I will refuse to let someone I feel responsible for, take ownership of something which was created by an individual who lacks the discipline to create it in the correct way. Ownership is the ultimate act of confidence. When you take ownership of something you say: “I believe in this, I will show the world how great it is!”.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My general message to organizations is that it is unwise to &lt;em&gt;assign&lt;/em&gt; ownership of something. People need to &lt;em&gt;take&lt;/em&gt; ownership and through the act of taking ownership, promise that they will adhere to their code of conduct, their discipline when working on that topic. We, as an organization, should only allow &lt;em&gt;craftsmen&lt;/em&gt; to take ownership. If we allow the inept to take ownership we are in for a world of trouble. Their great intentions will set us back more than if we had not created that piece of software in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Software, like pencils, can only be developed, improved an brought to the next level thanks to &lt;em&gt;Craftsmen&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Craftsmanship&lt;/em&gt; is the process of rigorously applying discipline to a problem until you are proud of the result and are willing to take ownership of that result. A &lt;em&gt;craftsmen&lt;/em&gt; realizes that they cannot do it alone and will actively seek out, learn from and train other people. They will collaborate with their peers until there is a community of like-minded &lt;em&gt;craftsmen&lt;/em&gt; challenging each other and continuously improving each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;craftsman&lt;/em&gt; realizes that they are not the alpha and the omega of a topic. They realize that they, purely by the fact that they came before, will be one of the shoulders on which the next generation will stand. A &lt;em&gt;craftsman&lt;/em&gt; is content in the fact that their skills, their discipline and their teaching will move their field forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am a technical fellow at Essent. I teach, I train and I help. My role is as much a detector of ineptness as it is an instigator of improvements through interaction. I take this seriously but I realize that I am not at the center of our journey towards &lt;em&gt;craftsmanship&lt;/em&gt;. For me, being a technical fellow is about embodying the four pillars of &lt;em&gt;craftsmanship&lt;/em&gt; and with my effort inspire the next generation of incredible engineers at Essent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;

                        &quot;html&quot;: &quot;&lt;p&gt;At Essent, our view on energy is that Sustainability and the energy transition are about people‘s behavior. We want to help everyone take their next step in energy and to do so we’ve planned simple, sustainable, and affordable solutions. In our ambition to deliver these products that will change the behavior of our customers, I’m convinced that we will need to deliver 100-fold product iterations before we hit the bullseye.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What does it take to become a true Tech Company?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious that energy and utilities need to transform into something sustainable and less dependent on foreign sources. Which is easier said than done. Essent and E.ON are positioned well to have a genuine impact on the global energy transition: we work with suppliers, customers, and all other parties involved. We do experiments, learn what works and also learn what doesn’t work. One of the crucial enablers for Essent to have this impact is a fast and reliable IT Delivery. This has to do with short feedback cycles, fast releases, small increments, high performance, and a great user experience. Taking on this role will help us to become a true Tech Company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Being a true tech company is not just about technology&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many aspects are equally relevant. In all these aspects, we can improve and continue to learn:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our leadership is inspiring and triggers real conversations driving sustainable continuous growth.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our engineers have automated repetitive and error-sensitive work so they can be creative and innovate together with our business.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our teams work on goals that relate to our customers. With end-to-end responsibility, they commit to results instead of deliverables.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our architecture is elegant. We understand it and co-create it along the way.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our technology is enabling us to accelerate and facilitates the craftsmanship of our engineers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our systems are simply great. We know what they do and we have zero planned downtime.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But most of all, as a tech company we put our customers first and our engineers in the driver&#x27;s seat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Our journey ahead&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last year we merged the old ops and dev teams into a DevOps teams. This means that our scrum teams are responsible for both new development and operational excellence in production. It took us about a year from the first pilot up until the last piece of ops responsibility we pulled into the ARTs. Now we’re planning for our next steps. We see three themes to work on:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A standardized Agile and DevOps way of working.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Simplified microservice architecture&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;And top tech talent.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this blog, we’re currently in sprint 187. For 186 times we have started and ended a sprint. Every three weeks, we learn, we deliver, and we improve. Still, we have a lot to learn and improve on. New teams have joined and new applications have been built.  We currently have 25 IT teams, organized in three Agile Release Trains, but often times it feels like this is not enough to keep up with our ambitions. That’s what I love about Essent. We’re never satisfied. Good enough is simply not excellent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each of the three themes we’re working on come with their own challenges, but the fun part is that every result on any of the three themes immediately affects the others. It’s like a set of gear wheels. No matter which one you turn, everything moves. Our landscape is complex and our market changes rapidly. Looking at these challenges ahead of us, one thing is very clear. It’s not about working hard. It’s about working smart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Want to share your ideas about our journey?

Everyone discusses what they plan to do today, and if someone is done with a project, we choose together the next topic we should start working on.

                        &quot;html&quot;: &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Each Friday is Techlab Day&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our way-of-working is quite simple: Each Friday is Techlab Day. We spend half of the Techlab days at the office and half of them online. We always start the day with a stand-up, in our Techlab room on our Techlab Slack channel. During the stand we check out the different projects we are currently working on. Everyone discusses what they plan to do today, and if someone is done with a project, we choose together the next topic we should start working on. We work on projects both individually, in couples and as a team. Sometimes we plan a brainstorm session to discuss different technologies and project ideas before we decide what to work on. After the stand-up, everyone starts working on their tasks. When we have an office day, we always go have lunch together in the city. The Essent Office is really close to the city centre of Den Bosch, and we are still trying out which diner serves the best tosti’s in town. After lunch we continue working on our projects and have meetings in case we need each other’s help to make progress. We end the day with a day closing: everyone shares what they did throughout the day, and we update the Trello board accordingly. On Office days, we often follow up the day closing with drinks at café Buurt only a few steps away from office. A great way to start the weekend!&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;

There are two ways ideas for new projects come to us:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We spot a new technology which we find interesting and try to find ways in which this technology can be useful for Essent.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A business case comes to our attention, and we try to find new technologies which could be useful in this specific use case.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When a technology is selected based on one of the above ways, we research the technology and set up a Proof-of-Concept (POC) or Proof-of-Technology (POT). This can lead to several outcomes: the POC can be successful, in which case we give advice to the business on how to further implement the technology. Or the POC failed, and we cannot make the technology work. Another option is the POC was successful, but we do not see added value here. In this case we advise the business to find a different solution. What is important to know is that the scope of Techlab ends after the advice: we do not fully implement solutions or execute maintenance after implementation. This is the responsibility of the business unit which will use the technology. Of course, we are always happy to help out if needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In our next post on this channel, we will share an example of a POT/POC we’re working on! Want to share your experiences with selecting innovative technology? Please leave a message. See you next Friday!&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;

Every team member works for a different team on “regular” days, but on Fridays we come together to work as the Techlab. The goal of the Techlab is to experiment with new technologies to improve our (current) business model and processes and to increase personal development opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, who is currently part of the Techlab team? From left to right we are Eva, Panos, Niels, Hannah and Ekta. So, let’s introduce ourselves!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hannah is the Techlab Lead and has been part of Techlab the longest. She works as a front-end DevOps engineer in the I Use FE team in the Believers ART. Within Techlab, she works on projects just like the other engineers, but also leads the Techlab by organizing the Techlab days, networking with colleagues in- and outside of Essent and making sure we stay true to our mission. Panos and Ekta are engineers from the same DevOps team as Hannah, and Niels is an engineer from the Siterocks team in the Changers ART. The three of them work on both individual and group projects for Techlab and use their creative minds to come up with and execute great POCs of new technologies. Eva is the management trainee of Essent IT and works on several projects throughout her traineeship, like sharing content on this platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;

        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Kobe Bryant, arguably one of the top ten basketball players to have ever played the game was a tremendous story teller. If you have ever seen his interviews you’ll know how much impact his words have had on a generation of basketball players. Storytelling is what drives our imagination; storytelling is what took our species from tribes trying to survive by gathering and hunting our food to a species on the cusp of interplanetary space travel. This is a story of how we should employ storytelling in our enterprise architecture.&quot;,

        &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Each Friday is Techlab Day. We spend half of the Techlab days at the office and half of them online. We always start the day with a stand-up, in our Techlab room on our Techlab Slack channel. During the stand we check out the different projects we are currently working on. Everyone discusses what they plan to do today, and if someone is done with a project, we choose together the next topic we should start working on. We work on projects both individually, in couples and as a team.&quot;,
